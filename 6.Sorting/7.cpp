///// QUICK SORT (divide and conquer algo) /////



/* 
    worst case time complexity O(N^2)
    despite of O(N^2) complexity it is considerd one of the best because of the following reasons :
    1. In-Place
    2. Cache friendly
    3. Avg case is O(N log N)
    4. Tail Recursive
    5. Partition is key function (Naive, Lomuto, Hoare) 
    6. unstable
