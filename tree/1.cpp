/////// APPLICATIONS OF TREE DS ///////
/*

    1. To store hirerichal data structure in memory
        - examples organisation structure, folder structure, html, xml basically nesting of tags
        - Javascript in browser reads html as a tree and manipulates the code
        - in heritance
        - binary search tree
        - binary heap(to prepresent priority queue)
        - B & B+ tree in DBMS(data bases)
        - spanning and shortest path trees
        - 

    pattern search in entire length of a string, or array, basically a sequence or subsequence search in O(length() of the given pattern)
        - Now to do this we need to pre-process the string and build a suffix tree and then do the search operation
