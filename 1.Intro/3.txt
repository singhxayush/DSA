types of data structures
    1. physical data structures
    2. logical data structures


Physical data structures
1. array - memory goes into stack by default but can also be created inside Heap
2. linked list - memory only goes into heap -> but since head is a pointer, it may go into stack(head only)

Logical data structures

1. stack      - lifo   |
2. queues     - fifo   |_ linear ds

3. trees      -        |
4. graph      -        |_ non linear ds

5. hash table -        |_ tabular



diff bet physical and logical ds
physical ds are more like container where as logical ds are like operations you can perform on phy data to manipulate them

IMPORTANT : ANY OF THE ABOVE GIVEN LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURES ARE MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED USING ARRAY OR LINKED LIST or combo of both
