STATIC VS DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION

1 - about main program
2 - how a program use memory
3 - STATIC ALLOCATION
4 - DYNAMIC ALLOCATION

    -memory is divided into smaller addressable unit called bytes
    -every byte is having its unique address
    
    -lets assume entire memory of the system is 64 kb (i.e. 0 - 65535)-> CALL IT AS A SEGMENT OF A MEMORY
    

HOW PROGRAM USES MAIN memroy
    1. we will take one segment of the memroy we will be studying it
    2. entire main memory is divided into three sections and used by a program
    3. code section, stack and heap.
        - area that is occupied in the main memory by the program is called code section of the program
        - when you declare any variable or create a data variable, its memory resides inside stack, this is basically called static memory allocation(decided at the compile time)
        - basically anything done at compile time or before run time is static


DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
    - Utilization of heap memory - unorganized memory
    - Heap memory should be treated as a resource
    - important practice - when required allocate the memory other wise delete the memory
    - program cant directly heap memory -> can only be done using pointer
